				<h2>Intro</h2>
				<p style="font-size: 15px;">College Puppy is a commerce website where students can buy and sell items from other people in their own school. All items are stored on a searchable database. For instance; after taking that great Economics class, you would normally leave the respective textbook in your drawer to rot. With College Puppy, you can sell it to another student right in your school.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    You can then do that student a favour by selling at a price lower than that at the school's bookstore. Not only books. You can literally sell anything. </p>

				<h2>Usage</h2>
				<p style="font-size: 15px;">College Puppy is really easy to use. As a seller, you fill out a simple form to upload your product's information. The product is then displayed on your school's main page by virtue of recency. It is also simultanously displayed by virtue of recency on many refined categories. Anyone browsing the site can see your product. If they like it, they can then buy. <br> 
                    <br>
                
                    As a buyer, after you have found a product you are inetrested in, click the name of the seller on the product's display. You can then fill a form to send them an email to contact them. Easy as that. No monetery transactions occur online.</p>

				<h2>More Features</h2>
				<p style="font-size: 15px;">If you find a product you are interested in, but are not ready to buy, you can click the heart on the product display to add it to your wishlist. You can visit your 'Wishlist' whenever you are ready, and then buy the product. The empty heart becomes full when you click. As you may have guessed, you can click the full heart, to make it empty, and take the respective product off the Wishlist. <br>
                
            <br>
                    Every item you put up for sale is stored under 'My Posted Items'. There, you can change your product's price and render your product 'SOLD OUT' when someone finally buys it. The 'SOLD OUT' tag will then replace the product's name on the display. This will discourage prospective buyers from inquiring about the product.
                </p>

				<h2>Post Your Needs</h2>
				<p style="font-size: 15px;">College Puppy understands that you may not find everything you want here. But that doesn't mean that no one in your school has that product.

The column is on display to everyone. If someone has what you are looking for, she can can just click your username and then contact you.</p>
